Result-oriented Security Engineer with deep expertise in Secure Internet Services and a specialization in Cloud Proxy solutions. As a subject-matter expert in Cloud Proxy, I bring a wealth of knowledge to effectively manage and support Squid proxy solutions, ensuring robust security on AWS/GCP proxies.

I have successfully built, configured, and deployed Squid Proxy solutions in diverse locations, leveraging the power of AWS/GCP infrastructure.
